evaluation:
what we want to evaluate? What we want to focus on?

> Is it effective? Can We measure A security level of a road through Ambiental Sensors Like Level of light , 
Loudness , relative Position respect to nearby Bar,pubs, Disco and others Points of interests?

> Device As : Network Performance(packets lost/data Rate + Power Consumption)

> Edge Proxy/Gateway As: Amount of Data collected, Possible Edge Computation of instant data and subsequent sent.

>Cloud Base As:  Communication protocols with proxies and clients portal , Type of Service and Knoledge offered  
and Overall Costs(data rates exchanges with cloud platform + device/proxy cost)

> effectiveness of service and knowledge extrapolated:
(User Experience and satisfaction)
For now we will focus on two knowledge: 
1.  we want to create a secure path through an urban area.
2. light and croud as indicator of security instead of obscure and not populated side streets
3. Density of pubs,bars and restaurants as synonimus of secure.
4. Idea of :  More people+light around implies  more secure areas.
