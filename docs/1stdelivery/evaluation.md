# Evaluation

The goal of this document is to providing information about "evalutation" of Project. This evaluation is based on the follow constraints:

- The evaluation of the performance of the network technologies
- The evaluation of the performance of the embedded devices in terms of power consumption and energy efficiency
- The evaluation of the response time from an end-user point of view

## Performance Evaluation
### Network Evaluation
> Device As : Network Performance(packets lost/data Rate + Power Consumption)

> AWS : Amount of Data collected, Possible node  Computation of instant data and subsequent sent.

>Cloud Base As:  Communication protocols with proxies and clients portal , Type of Service and Knoledge offered  
and Overall Costs(data rates exchanges with cloud platform + device/proxy cost)
### Performance of embedded devices

### Evaluation of end-user experience
We focus on effectiveness of service and knowledge extrapolated
1.  we want to create a secure path through an urban area
2. light and croud as indicator of security instead of obscure and not populated side streets
3. Density of pubs, bars and restaurants as synonimus of secure

- Idea of "More people and light implies more secure areas" is effective? 
- Can We measure Safety of roads through Ambiental Sensors and density of Points of interests in the area?
