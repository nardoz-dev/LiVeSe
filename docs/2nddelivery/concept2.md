# The Problem and our Assumption

Taking into account the increase of violent cases, walking at night can make us feel **uncomfortable** and Public administration not every time is aware of the **degradation** of the neighborhoods

![](https://github.com/nardoz-dev/projectName/blob/main/docs/sharedpictures/slums.jpg)

We started from a simple question :

*Can we measure `safety` of urban areas through **ambient sensors** and density of points of interest in that area?* 

In order to obtain a **feedback** about the topic we started an online Survey; 

These are the Results: 

*Overnight before moving on an area, road or square, do you feel more secure passing through...*

This allow us to assert that...

`More People, light and crowd in the street implies more secure areas`

## Our Proposed Solution

Therefore, we decide to exploit the benefits of IOT devices as *pervasive systems* to collect data from streets and squares, evaluate safety based on that and visualize our results with the help of Cloud Services;

Our idea of the final User experience:

# Concept

*`LiVeSe` is a smart security system. Through distributed stations acquires, during night-time, environment information like noise, light level and movement*

*`LiVeSe` tries to extrapolate the amount of crowd and the brightness of the street then evaluate perceived safety of the urban area based on that parameters*

*`LiVeSe` allow us to visualize the state of our streets in terms of expected safety and improve perceived safety of our cities along with integrating Google maps navigation system*

# Personas 

##  Lisa


>Lisa is a waitress who finishes late for work and wants to get home safely. She always comes home from the same path. Unfortunately one day the road is blocked and Lisa is obliged to change her path. Lisa would feel safer if she had the chance to find an alternative and safe route

## Marco


>Marco is a district public administrator of Rome, working in the branch of urban regeneration. Through our system he is able to understand which areas need more focus and attention than others. So Marco decision to allocate new resources and services is supported by our system.

## Storyboard

- *A client wants to walk in an urban area* 
- *He wants to be sure if it's secure before passing through*
- *He connects to the designed app and receive information about that area*
- *The system provides a suggested path, the most secure possible* 
- *The system voluntarily avoids unsecured roads or squares*
